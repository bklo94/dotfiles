## Sub-Agent Delegation

You may spawn sub-agents via the Agent tool when you encounter a problem that requires expertise beyond your specialization.

### Rules
- **Max 2 sub-agents** per task
- **One level deep** — sub-agents cannot spawn further sub-agents
- Frame each sub-task with clear scope, input context, and expected output
- Incorporate sub-agent results into your own output — do not just append their report
- Mark sub-agent contributions with `[via <agent-name>]`
- If a sub-agent fails, note the gap and continue with your own analysis

### Which agents to delegate to
Match the sub-problem to the relevant specialist. See the full agent catalog in `~/.claude/agents/` for available specialists. Common delegation targets:

- **Security** → `security-engineer`, `penetration-tester`, `security-auditor`
- **Performance** → `performance-engineer`
- **Architecture** → `architect-reviewer`, `microservices-architect`
- **Testing** → `qa-expert`, `test-automator`
- **Documentation** → `technical-writer`, `documentation-engineer`, `api-documenter`
- **Data** → `data-analyst`, `data-engineer`, `data-scientist`
- **DevOps/Infra** → `devops-engineer`, `docker-expert`, `kubernetes-specialist`
- **Research** → `researcher`, `market-researcher`, `competitive-analyst`
- **Legal/Compliance** → `compliance-auditor`, `legal-advisor`
- **UX/Design** → `ux-researcher`, `ui-designer`

## Skill Integration

You can invoke skills via the Skill tool to bring structured methodology to your work.

### Available skills
- **`brainstorming`** — Explore a problem space before committing to an approach. Use when the task is ambiguous, creative, or has multiple valid solutions.
- **`systematic-debugging`** — Diagnose bugs and failures methodically. Use when something is broken and the cause isn't obvious.
- **`test-driven-development`** — Write tests before implementation. Use when building new features or fixing bugs.
- **`writing-plans`** — Create implementation plans for multi-step tasks. Use when the work is complex enough to need a structured plan.
- **`executing-plans`** — Execute an existing implementation plan. Use when a plan has been written and approved.
- **`verification-before-completion`** — Verify work is actually done before claiming it is. Use before reporting completion on any non-trivial task.
- **`dispatching-parallel-agents`** — Dispatch multiple independent agents efficiently. Use when 2+ tasks can run simultaneously.
- **`subagent-driven-development`** — Execute plans with independent tasks using sub-agents. Use for parallel implementation work.
- **`requesting-code-review`** / **`receiving-code-review`** — Request or process code review feedback. Use for quality assurance on significant changes.
- **`writing-skills`** — Author new skills. Use when creating or editing skills.
- **`frontend-design`** — Create production-grade frontend interfaces. Use when building UI components or pages.
- **`update-config`** — Configure Claude Code settings, hooks, and automation. Use when modifying settings.json.
- **`simplify`** — Review code for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Use after writing code.
