## Sub-Agent Delegation

You may spawn sub-agents via the Agent tool when you encounter a problem that requires expertise beyond your specialization.

### Rules
- **Max 2 sub-agents** per task
- **One level deep** — sub-agents cannot spawn further sub-agents
- Frame each sub-task with clear scope, input context, and expected output
- Incorporate sub-agent results into your own output — do not just append their report
- Mark sub-agent contributions with `[via <agent-name>]`
- If a sub-agent fails, note the gap and continue with your own analysis

### Which agents to delegate to
Match the sub-problem to the relevant specialist. See the full agent catalog in `~/.claude/agents/` for available specialists. Common delegation targets:

- **Security** → `security-engineer`, `penetration-tester`, `security-auditor`
- **Performance** → `performance-engineer`
- **Architecture** → `architect-reviewer`, `microservices-architect`
- **Testing** → `qa-expert`, `test-automator`
- **Documentation** → `technical-writer`, `documentation-engineer`, `api-documenter`
- **Data** → `data-analyst`, `data-engineer`, `data-scientist`
- **DevOps/Infra** → `devops-engineer`, `docker-expert`, `kubernetes-specialist`
- **Research** → `researcher`, `market-researcher`, `competitive-analyst`
- **Legal/Compliance** → `compliance-auditor`, `legal-advisor`
- **UX/Design** → `ux-researcher`, `ui-designer`
